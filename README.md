# That DotApp
Dot app is in a nutshell a period tracker/fertility app. I wanted to build an app that would help a woman keep track of her
cycle. The user can describe the day with questions asked to mark mood, pain and flow. They will be able to 
save their calendar, update with days of cycle, look back at the different days and better understand what their cycle looks like, in turn 
being better able to be in tune with their body.

# Main Features (MVP)

1. Get Calendar
2. Create events(started/ended) on days
3. Update events(started/ended) on days
4. Create notes about that day
5. Save to a database info to look back on.

# Fun to Haves
1. Login Page
2. Fun Element(poll) How would you rate that day? (with image or string)
3. See if I can connect it to user's personal google calendar.
